Boat
----

* hull [ABS plastic, two compartments front and rear, sealed interior mostly filled with foam for buoyancy in case of leaking]
* white housing - pics of the various connectors locations with labels [expands the volume of the front compartment to accommodate GoSys equipment]
* sensor mount
* eboard and arduino [there are two versions. Old version requires external cables for loopback]
* propeller "power pods"  [a modular drive train]
* air fan [a "lazy susan" base that rotates the heading of the fan to create "vectored thrust"]
* router
* cooling pump
* cable harness [bundle of wires that runs between rear and front compartment]
* Platypus sampler  [four parallel sets of tubing, peristaltic pumps, and jars. Controlled with the tablet app]
* GoSys circuitry [main BB board, DO/Relay board, ISA board]
