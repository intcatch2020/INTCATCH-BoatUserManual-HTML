Timeline of a Sampling Campaign
===============================

There are four major time segments for any campaign:

#. Preparing the day or night before the campaign.
#. Setting up to deploy the boat at the start of the data collection.
#. During the data collection.
#. After the data collection, including any long term post-processing of the data.
