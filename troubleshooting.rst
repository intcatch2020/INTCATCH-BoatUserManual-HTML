* boat will not turn on
* ESCs do not beep as expected
* tablet app crashes when you try to connect to boat
* tablet will not connect to the boat
* tablet connects to boat, but does not display battery voltage or other sensor data
* BlueBox will not turn on (maybe wires are loose?)
* Phone vibrates or makes warning sounds repeatedly (something in the serial loopback chain is not working, USB must be in arduino's native port)
* Phone has stopped warning about missing bluebox, but data doesn't appear on tablet
* Arrow representing boat does not appear on the map (phone does not have GPS fix)
* Arrow representing boat does not point in the right direction
* Sensor data parameters disappear from the bottom of the tablet app
* Data is not appearing in WAIS/web app
* boat WiFi never appears
* Don't hear the pump running in the rear compartment
* don't remember password to boat WiFi

* The propellers are turning in the wrong direction
* Sensor ___ is not working
* Propeller boat turns in circles (broken prop)
* Propeller boat banks to one side despite trying to drive straight (prop reverse pair not installed correctly)
* LiPo battery is puffy
* Oops, a wire came loose or I damaged ___
* Tablet has lost connection to phone, but RC still works (phone may have crashed, WiFi signal too weak)
* Tablet is connected but boat won't start any waypoints (RC override is probably on)
* The tablet app map and waypoints don't match where the boat actually is
* The tablet app map doesn't show any water (too small)
* The tablet app map doesn't load (forgot to cache it)
* Blueblox data does not appear in WAIS/web app (bluebox may not have GPS fix or SIM card connection)
* Cooling pump makes gurgling noises (air in the system, coolant may have leaked)
